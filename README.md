# AirBnB_clone

## Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! - The console

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project 
with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration e.t.c

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, 
serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: 
Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


## Usage ðŸ’»

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

Command | Example
------- | -------
Run the console | ```./console.py```
Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit```
Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>```
Create an object (prints its id)| ```(hbnb) create <class>```
Show an object | ```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)```
Destroy an object | ```(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)```
Show all objects, or all instances of a class | ```(hbnb) all``` or ```(hbnb) all <class>```
Update an attribute of an object | ```(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")```

### Interactive mode (example)

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### Non-interactive mode (example)

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```

## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the [tests](./tests)
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
